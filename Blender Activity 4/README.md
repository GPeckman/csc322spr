## Checkpoint 1

All three images (diffuse, glossy, and transmission) appear to be indistinguishable from each other.

## Checkpoint 2

The cube under the glass sphere is visibly blurred along the x-axis, as though it is moving at high speed.

## Checkpoint 3

Every object in the image except for the glass sphere is slightly blurry, as though out of focus.

## Checkpoint 4

After adding the cube with the volume material, the whole scene appears foggy.
